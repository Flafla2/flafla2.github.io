*This project was originally created for the class 62-150 Intro to Media
Synthesis and Analysis at Carnegie Mellon University in the Fall of 2016.
It was orignally posted [here][xsead-link].  The demo is currently not available
for download, however I intend on releasing it when I have access to a VR
system again.*

The essential idea of this project is to translate the Op-Art works of painter 
Bridget Riley into an interactive digital museum.  The museum is experienced in 
VR, using the HTC Vive.  I believe VR is a perfect platform for this kind of 
project, as VR itself is an illusory medium.  Some interesting fourth-wall-breaking 
connections can be made between the headset itself and Op-Art.  VR further adds 
to the experience by contributing a sense of scale - large virtual objects actually 
appear large, which may not be immediately apparent on a computer screen.  This 
is especially important when interpreting the works of Riley, who is known for 
the depth and scale she brings to her works.  Additionally in a digital museum 
I can make objects behave in ways that are impossible in real life; this gives 
me a lot of freedom when curating the museum.

## Product

The final product is an interactive VR museum containing digital recreations of 
the works of Bridget Riley.  The experience has been developed for the SteamVR 
Platform, and optimized for the HTC Vive headset and controllers.  Users have the 
ability to walk around the virtual space in room scale.  Additionally they may 
teleport around the museum using a simple pointer mechanism; this allows the 
museum to be larger than the real-life play area.  I have also included a 
digital "pamphlet" that provides some information / context about the work that 
the user is currently looking at.  Below is a demonstration of these concepts:

## Intent

My intent in making this project was to explore VR as an artistic medium.  What,
exactly, does VR offer as opposed to traditional (2D) media?  The way I see it,
VR has three major advantages over traditional games/digital media.  Firstly, VR
is of course more immersive and makes the user feel like they are inside the
virtual space.  Secondly, the stereoscopic 3D that VR headsets offer adds a
sense of scale and depth that is impossible on a 2D display.  Lastly, in VR I
can add virtual spaces that move in a way that is impossible in reality.  The
works of Bridget Riley are very compatible with these traits: in her paintings,
Riley implies depth and movement through striking geometric forms.  It should
come as no surprise, then, that VR is an essential part of the experience.
Without it, the pieces are significantly less striking.

## List of Pieces

Below I list each of the works, along with a corresponding blurb from the pamphlet.

### Blaze

> The word 'paradox' has always had a kind of magic for me, and I think my 
> pictures have a paradoxical quality, a paradox of chaos and order in one.
> 
> -- Bridget Riley

<div style="max-width:512px;display:block;margin:0 auto;">
    <div class="gfyitem" data-autoplay="true" data-responsive="true" data-id="ImaginaryGiantAltiplanochinchillamouse"></div>
</div>

Blaze is unique in that it simultaneously captures Riley's ability to render 
depth and movement. My rendering of Blaze attempts to echo both of these 
elements in a way that is striking and, in some ways, unsettling. 
Are you looking at a tunnel? Perhaps it is a flame, as the title suggests? O
r are you staring down the barrel of a gun?

### Movement in Squares

> For me nature is not landscape, but the dynamism of visual forces, an event 
> rather than an appearance.
> 
> -- Bridget Riley

<div style="max-width:512px;display:block;margin:0 auto;">
    <div class="gfyitem" data-autoplay="true" data-responsive="true" data-id="ShadyCelebratedHornedtoad"></div>
</div>

Movement in Squares is one of Riley's definitive pieces, and demonstrates her 
ability to encapsulate depth in its rawest form. I made the work so huge to 
capture this feeling. The user can teleport directly over the work as well to 
experience this sense of scale more directly.

### Fall

> I used to build up to sensation, accumulating tension until it released 
> a perceptual experience
> 
> -- Bridget Riley

<div style="max-width:512px;display:block;margin:0 auto;">
    <div class="gfyitem" data-autoplay="true" data-responsive="true" data-id="BetterValuableBighorn"></div>
</div>

Fall hurts to look at; that, to me, is what makes it so interesting. In Fall, 
Riley implies a waterfall-like flowing motion while also creating optical 
resonances that are downright painful at times. Fall was the first work that I 
studied by Riley and introduced me to the basic idea of this project.

### Untitled [Fragment 6/9]

> In general, my paintings are multifocal. You can't call it unfocused space, 
> but not being fixed to a single focus is very much of our time.
> 
> -- Bridget Riley

<div style="max-width:512px;display:block;margin:0 auto;">
    <div class="gfyitem" data-autoplay="true" data-responsive="true" data-id="IckySelfassuredChick"></div>
</div>

Untitled [Fragment 6/9] has a strange sort of unexplainable tension. Upon closer
inspection, the various dots strewn across the canvas are quite random, but from
a distance they are gridlike. The planetoids themselves, reminiscent of Kandinsky,
similarly imply depth through their size.

### Untitled [Fragment 3/11]

> The eye can travel over the surface in a way parallel to the way it moves
> over nature. It should feel caressed and soothed, experience frictions and
> ruptures, glide and drift. One moment, there will be nothing to look at and 
> the next second the canvas seems to refill, to be crowded with visual events.
> 
> -- Bridget Riley

<div style="max-width:512px;display:block;margin:0 auto;">
    <div class="gfyitem" data-autoplay="true" data-responsive="true" data-id="WetImmediateAstrangiacoral"></div>
</div>

Untitled [Fragment 3/11] was definitely the most challenging work for me to
decompose digitally. A complex system of unintuitive curves and surfaces, this
(ultimately cylindrical) form is hard to understand even after staring at it for
minutes.

### Cataract 3

> I learned from Seurat this important thing about colour and light, that 'a
> light' can be built from colour. I learned a great deal about interaction,
> that 'a blue' in different parts will play all sorts of different roles.
> 
> -- Bridget Riley

<div style="max-width:512px;display:block;margin:0 auto;">
    <div class="gfyitem" data-autoplay="true" data-responsive="true" data-id="TalkativeTenderAdmiralbutterfly"></div>
</div>

Although Riley is most known for her grayscale works (such as the others shown
here) she has also experimented heavily with color. Cataract 3 is similar in
form to Fall (directly behind you), but it also integrates color into the work.
Try stepping close to the piece to see how Riley constructed the colors in it.

## Context

### Bridget Riley, Related Works

Bridget Riley, the focus of my digital museum, is a well known contributor to
the Op-Art (optical art) movement.  Op-Art, an extension of abstract expressionism,
focused on the utilization of Optical Illusions to imply different visual effects.
Bridget Riley used these illusions in many cases to give her paintings a sense of
depth and space.

<p style="text-align: center">
    <img src="/img/2016-11-28-riley/context-1.jpeg" style="text-align: center; width: 100%; max-width: 400px;" /><br />
</p>

In other cases, she used Optical Illusions to imply movement and animation:

<p style="text-align: center">
    <img src="/img/2016-11-28-riley/context-2.jpeg" style="text-align: center; width: 100%; max-width: 400px;" /><br />
</p>

As the focus of the museum, Riley's paintings are a clear focal point of my
research when developing the experience.  It is particularly important to break
the works down into their atomic elements, and identify their implied movement or
spaciality.  This will allow me to reconstruct them in 3 dimensions.

### MonzaMakers, Caravaggio Recreation

[Link to the work.][monzamakers-carvaggio]

As mentioned, one of the central aims of the project is to realize the
two-dimensional implied depth of Riley's paintings in a 3 dimensional medium
(VR).  It turns out that MonzaMakers, an Italian 3D printing company, has
attempted to do something similar.  Their goal was to transport the implied
depth and perspective of Caravaggioâ€™s Flagellation of Christ into the real world
so that the visually impaired can feel the pieces and understand them.  My goal
is quite similar, but in a freer digital medium.

</p>

### Super Hyper Cube

[Link to the work.][superhypercube]

## TODO: LINK VIDEO

One excellent implementation of the aesthetic elements of Op Art in VR is
Polytron's game SUPERHYPERCUBE.  Superhypercube is a simple game by itself,
but it's style and feel make it truly shine.  I found the game's successful
utility of simple shapes and abstract geometry to create powerful and
interesting spaces to be particularly applicable to Bridget Riley's similarly
abstract style.  It has inspired me to experiment with similarly huge spaces in
VR, to push the boundaries of what is even possible in a real-life museum.

### The VR Museum of Fine Art

[Link to the work.][vrmuseumoffineart]

This is perhaps the most direct analogy I could find to my project.  The VR
Museum of Fine Art allows players to explore famous works of art in 1:1 scale -
all curated in a digital museum.  Perhaps the most useful aspect of this project
to my own creation is the aesthetic realization of a museum in VR.  Additionally
I really liked the interactive elements of the museum - VR offers a unique
opportunity to add interactive descriptions, etc to the artworks.

## Process

The experience is powered by the Unity game engine, and all art assets
(including most of the pieces themselves as well as the environment art) were
made in Blender (a 3D modeling suite).  Additionally, some of the pieces (Fall
and Cataract 3) are completely generated in code.  I have outlined my specific
process in creating some of these pieces in my briefs for [Fall, Remixed][fallremixed] and [Animating Paintings][animatingpaintings] (two previous iterations of this project).  Since the
previous version of the museum (Animating Paintings) I have added three pieces
to the museum.  I also redesigned the general layout of the museum and added
VR support.  I used the [SteamVR API][steamvr] for HTC Vive integration.  For locomotion
(including the teleportation mechanic) I used my own open source [HTC Vive
Teleportation System for Unity][viveteleport] that I developed last spring for another project.
Below are some pictures of some of the assets I created for this project.

## Reflection

I'm really happy with how this project turned out.  I noticed that, when
presenting the final product, different people enjoyed drastically different
parts of the experience.  Interestingly, one player told me that the more surreal
exhibits (Blaze and Movement in Squares) were out of place, whereas another
player told me to make them even more strange and detached from reality.
Similarly, some players never used the Pamphlet mechanic but others looked at
the pamphlets more than the actual exhibits!  In general, every player was
interested in or impressed by some aspect of the experience, and I am very proud
of that.  I think there is still a lot of potential in this project, and I plan
on expanding upon it further in the future.  One way to do this is to simply add
more exhibits and improve the overall polish and aesthetics of the existing
environment.  Another way is to add more interactivity - what if, for example,
you could touch the exhibits in VR to change their animation / behavior?
